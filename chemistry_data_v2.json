      "question": "What is an ionic bond?",
      "options": [
        "A chemical bond formed by sharing a pair of electrons between atoms",
        "A chemical bond formed by the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions",
        "A bond between two nonmetal atoms",
        "A weak attraction between neutral molecules"

      "difficulty": 1,
      "learning_objective": "Define ionic bonding",
      "skills": ["recall"],
      "explanation": "Ionic bonds form when one atom transfers electrons to another, producing positive and negative ions that attract each other.",

        "0": "Describes covalent bonding (electron sharing), not ionic.",

      "difficulty": 1,
      "learning_objective": "Recognise simple ion formation from electron loss/gain",
      "skills": ["recall"],
      "explanation": "When sodium loses one electron it becomes a singly charged positive ion, Na⁺.",
      "distractor_rationale": {
        "0": "Na⁻ would be a negatively charged ion (gained an electron) — incorrect for Na losing an electron.",
        "2": "Na²⁺ would require loss of two electrons; sodium typically loses one.",
        "3": "NaO is not a single sodium ion; it's a compound fragment and incorrect here."

      "question": "When magnesium reacts with chlorine to form magnesium chloride (MgCl₂), what happens?",
      "options": [
        "Each magnesium atom loses two electrons; each chlorine atom gains one electron",
        "Magnesium shares electrons with chlorine to form covalent bonds",

      "explanation": "Magnesium (Mg) loses two electrons to form Mg²⁺; each chlorine atom gains one electron to form Cl⁻. Two Cl⁻ ions balance one Mg²⁺, giving MgCl₂.",
      "distractor_rationale": {
        "1": "Electron sharing is covalent bonding, not what happens here.",
        "2": "This reverses the actual electron transfer; magnesium does not gain electrons in this reaction.",

      "question": "Which property is typical of ionic compounds compared with covalent molecular compounds?",
      "options": [
        "They have high melting and boiling points and conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in water",
        "They usually have low melting points and exist as gases at room temperature",

      "skills": ["analysis"],
      "explanation": "Ionic compounds form strong lattices (high melting/boiling points). Their ions are mobile when molten or in solution, so they conduct electricity.",
      "distractor_rationale": {
        "1": "Low melting points and gaseous state describe many covalent molecular compounds, not ionic lattices.",

      "difficulty": 3,
      "learning_objective": "Apply Coulomb's law qualitatively to predict lattice energy",
      "skills": ["application", "critical thinking"],
      "explanation": "Lattice energy increases with larger ionic charges and smaller ionic radii. MgO has +2 and −2 ions, so the charge product is larger than the others (which are +1/−1), giving MgO the highest lattice energy.",

        "2": "KCl has larger ions and only +1/−1 charges, so its lattice energy is lower."
