# Chemdo Adaptive Chemistry API

This repository contains:
- **chemistry_data.json** — core dataset of chemistry questions.
- **progression_algorithm.py** — adaptive difficulty logic.
- **user_state.json** — example user progress file.

You can run the Python file locally to test adaptive question selection.
In the future, this logic could power a `/next_question` endpoint for an AI tutor.
